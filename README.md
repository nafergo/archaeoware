# Richmond, VA - Health Services List

Despite the many existing health and social services in the city of Richmond, organizations have trouble keeping their lists up-to-date. Many people making referrals have their own up-to-date list in a Google spreadsheet or other formats but they are typically not shared with other people and their data are not available to the public.

This project takes a multi-sheet Google spreadsheet of health and social services in Richmond, VA and turns them into a searchable list. The data are provided by the [Center on Society and Health](http://www.societyhealth.vcu.edu/) at VCU. This is a project by the [2015 Richmond Fellowship team](http://rva.codeforamerica.org).

### Status

This is an ongoing project and is not intended for official use.

### What is this built with?

This project uses [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) for the spreadsheet access, [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for some templating, [List.js](http://www.listjs.com/) for the searchable list, and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the styles.
